## Projects

### 1. [Flow Logs Processor](./Flow-Logs-Processor)
**Description:** This project demonstrates ETL skills by processing AWS VPC Flow log data. It extracts data from input files, transforms it by mapping each row to a tag based on a lookup table, and loads the results into a CSV report.

**Key Features:**
- Parses and processes AWS VPC Flow Logs
- Performs data mapping using a lookup table
- Generates summary reports with tag counts and port/protocol statistics
- Implements memory-efficient processing for large datasets

**Technologies Used:** Python, CSV
